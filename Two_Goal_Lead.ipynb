        "In the recently released [All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188556/) documentary, Jose Mourinho, one of the sport's most decorated coaches, can be heard reiterating this statement (albeit in slightly different words). \n",

        "To do so we will use the [Football Events](https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events) Kaggle dataset which contains match event data such as goals scored from roughly 9,000 games from Europe's top 5 leagues. \n",
        "\n",
        "In particular we will examine 3 possible interpretations. \n",
        "1.   A team with a 2-0 lead will ultimately lose or draw games more often than with other leads (we'll use 1-0 leads for comparison)\n",
        "2.   A team with a 2-0 lead is more likely to concede the next goal than with other leads. \n",

        "So despite the weak evidence from the time to concede analysis, I think we can safely say 2-0 is not the most dangerous lead. Overwhelmingly teams with 2-0 leads win more often and concede the next goal less often than teams with 1-0 leads. And we haven't even mentioned the well known [truly most dangerous 3-0 lead.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_UEFA_Champions_League#Semi-finals)  "
